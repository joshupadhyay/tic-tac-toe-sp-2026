## TicTacToe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic 2 player game. This repository attempts to build this game from first principles. 

The game is comprised of a `Board`, which is made up of nine `Cells`. 

Each `Cell` can contain 3 values at most - an X, an O, or null. 

Each player will take turns selecting a `Cell` to populate. 

Any 3 symbols (X or O) in a row will cause the game to end.
